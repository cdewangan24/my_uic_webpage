# Chesta's UIC-themed Webpage

The code is modified from the source code of [Prof. Jakob Eriksson's personal website](https://github.com/bitslab/jakob_webpage).

<!-- 
To use this as a template, start by updatin the settings in `_data/defaults.json' to reflect your name, title and a suitable portrait. Delete the contents of 'photos/' and add some of your own. Use landscape oriented photos of high resolution, and with your face fairly prominent and centered. Then, simply edit `home.md`, `projects.md` and `news.md` with your own content, and you're good to go.

To try it out, run `npm start` in the main folder, and open your website in a browser using the URL `localhost:8080`. 
The `Makefile` contains a handy target for uploading your site to your Computer Science department `WWW` folder. Works for me, but your YMMV as that's a pretty outdated system. -->
