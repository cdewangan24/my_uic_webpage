# About me
I’m in my final semester of my Master’s in Computer Science at UIC, pursuing the project-based path. Throughout my journey, I’ve explored areas such as AI, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction, and discovered a true passion for Human-Centered Computing. My experience includes projects in data visualization, mobile app development, data science and gesture-based systems. Beyond the classroom, I actively contribute to the campus community through leadership roles in SWE, GradSWE, and the Women in Engineering Programs.
