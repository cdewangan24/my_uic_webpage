Below are some of the projects I have worked on or am working on right now.

#
**Master's Project**\
An interdisciplinary project at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Learning, focusing on improving how users interact with evolving interfaces.

#
**Chicago 311 Service Requests Visualization**\
An interactive visual analytics project to explore Chicago’s 311 service request data. Using Vega, Vega-Lite, and Curio, I created visualizations to get insight into how city services are utilized by analyzing the distribution of service requests across neighborhoods and zip codes. Compare request volumes by department and examine year-over-year trends. Map the geospatial spread of service requests to identify clusters and hotspots. Investigate correlations among features to uncover patterns in request types and service delivery.

#
**Digital vs Physical Note-Taking: Understanding Users’ Preferences**\
This study examined differences between digital and physical note-taking in academic settings, analyzing performance, user preferences, and challenges. Task performance, retrieval times, and collected interview data were measured using a mixed-method approach.

#
**PrognosiX**\
A tool built to assist medical specialists in early detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by analyzing patient data and developing predictive models. The system incorporates data visualization to present patient information clearly and simulate CKD risk, supporting more informed decision-making.

# 
**Painting Application**\
An Android app that lets users draw freehand and transforms inputs into precise, standardized shapes using Natural User Interfaces (NUI). The app recognizes basic shapes (circles, squares, triangles) as well as custom ones, and supports gesture commands like ‘+’ to start a new drawing or ‘✓’ to save, simplifying interaction without traditional menus or buttons.
